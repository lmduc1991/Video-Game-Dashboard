### **Project Overview**

In this project, we built a Dashboard to illustrate video games sales for global and each market, including: North America, Japan, Europe and Others by capitalizing functions and tools of **Power BI**. Data used was extracting from file **vgsales** - csv file which was retrieved from [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data)
)

### **Data Understanding**
